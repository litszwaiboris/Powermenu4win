# Powermenu4win
##### A simple .NET app for shutting down and reboot
---
This is an application for executing by shortcut like keylaunch in Rainmeter or using for create shortcut in mouse to easier execute command.
- Shutdown 
- Restart 
- Hibernate (must be enabled in Windows to use this option) 😂
- Logout
Remember to use powershell to execute the .exe file but not cmd because of something wrong with it 😅

The macOS and linux version is coming soon!👍 

Developed by a hobbist programming learner who is 12 years old so if there are any problem please regret me and kindly notice me on issues of this repo, thanks!
